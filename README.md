# ഗുരുത്വം METER 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: 502 Bad Gateway


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Devika M Nair - LBS Institute of Technology for Women
- Member 2: Aleena Jaison - LBS Institute of Technology for Women
- Member 3: Akshaya Mugin - LBS Institute of Technology for Women

### Project Description
It simply calculates your ഗുരുത്വം through a question.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It has been observed in GenZ the lack of sufficient ഗുരുത്വം to lead a very demure life. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We have developed a 'ഗുരുത്വം METER' where a question will be asked to the user and according to the choice he/she selected, the ഗുരുത്വം will be calculated and displayed.
